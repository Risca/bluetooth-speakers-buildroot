	  Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend

	  This project is a rebirth of a direct integration between Bluez and
	  ALSA. Since Bluez >= 5, the build-in integration has been removed in
	  favor of 3rd party audio applications. From now on, Bluez acts as a
	  middleware between an audio application, which implements Bluetooth
	  audio profile, and a Bluetooth audio device.
